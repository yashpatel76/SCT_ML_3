# SCT_ML_3
A simple image classification project using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish between cat and dog images. The dataset is preprocessed by converting images to grayscale, resizing, flattening, and then fed into an SVM model for binary classification. Implemented using OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
